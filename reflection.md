What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?


I had a hard time getting started on this assignment because it's been so long since I've done any coding and I have never done any object oriented program. I went to tutoring a few times which was really helpful to talk through the code and what the assignment was asking. Overall, I thought it was a good reintroduction to coding. 

The hardest part for me was understanding what code needed to be in the computer file and which had to be in the object oriented resale shop file. Specifically, making computers was confusing to me since all the code for how to do so was in the computer file but I couldn't figure out a way to make a computer in one file and access it through the other. I'm not entirely sure I've done that part correctly.
